## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

üå± I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** and I enjoy building websites, apps, and technical projects to help other people. I am a creative thinker, and my journey in web development has been driven by my passion for learning, seeing small changes make a big impact, and the sense of community that comes with working on projects with others.

üéí I am a recent graduate from [**BrainStation Vancouver**](https://brainstation.io/vancouver), where I completed their [web development bootcamp](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp)! I also graduated from Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada where I studied [**Software Systems**](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) (a branch of Computing Science) and [**Interactive Arts and Technology**](https://www.sfu.ca/siat/programs/undergraduate/prospective-students.html).

üëÄ I am early in my career in the tech industry and have been interested in (and have studied) web development, software development, technical writing, and developer relations.

üí° Nevertheless, these experiences have instilled in me a lifelong passion for learning, innovation, and empathy-driven community building. Witnessing coding projects succeed and benefit the end-user has been what has kept me motivated.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Tech Toolbox

## üöÄ What I've Built

I'm proud of the projects I've developed, which showcase my ability to blend creativity with functionality:

I'm currently ranked **5 kyu** on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), a platform where developers enhance their coding skills by solving challenges (called "kata"). My 5 kyu rank reflects an **intermediate level of problem-solving ability**, where I tackle complex algorithms, data structures, and real-world programming problems. This experience helps me write more efficient, reliable, and maintainable code in my projects.

## üåê Let's Connect!

I'm always on the lookout for web development opportunities and related areas. If you think I'd be a great fit for your team or company, I'd love to hear from you. I'm also open to smaller projects and giving back to the tech community through mentoring and teaching. Let's chat!

## üé∏ Beyond the Code

When I'm not deep in code, you'll often find me exploring another passion of mine‚Äîmusic. I'm a songwriter who loves translating thoughts into melodies. I enjoy writing and recording my original songs and sharing them with friends and the wider community.

I also believe in giving back to the tech community, whether it's mentoring at hackathons, teaching coding to kids, or volunteering at tech socials. I find it fulfilling to inspire the next generation of developers in making the world a better place!
