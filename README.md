## Who is Josh and what does he do?

🌱 I enjoy building websites, apps, and technical projects to help other people. I am a creative thinker, and my journey in web development has been driven by my passion for learning, seeing small changes make a big impact, and the sense of community that comes with working on projects with others.

🎒 I am a recent graduate from [**BrainStation Vancouver**](https://brainstation.io/vancouver), where I completed their [web development bootcamp](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp)! I also graduated from Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada where I studied [**Software Systems**](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) (a branch of Computing Science) and [**Interactive Arts and Technology**](https://www.sfu.ca/siat/programs/undergraduate/prospective-students.html).

👀 I am early in my career in the tech industry and have been interested in (and have studied) web development, software development, technical writing, and developer relations.

💡 Nevertheless, these experiences have instilled in me a lifelong passion for learning, innovation, and empathy-driven community building. Witnessing coding projects succeed and benefit the end-user has been what has kept me motivated.

🎸 During my spare time, I design graphics for a few places I volunteer at. I also play guitar and write songs!

🚀 I'm also casually looking for small projects to work on (in the style of "building an app with my close friends from the university") and ways to help the tech community (like mentoring hackathons and teaching people). So, if you want to do that, let's talk too!
