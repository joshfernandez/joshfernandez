# Hello, I'm @joshfernandez! 👋

🎒 I am a recent graduate from Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada and I studied [**Software Systems**](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) (a branch of Computing Science) and [**Interactive Arts and Technology**](https://www.sfu.ca/siat/programs/undergraduate/prospective-students.html).

👀 I am early in my career in the tech industry and have been interested in (and have studied) web development, software development, technical writing, and developer relations.

🌱 I love to build and design websites and educational and creative web/mobile apps. I also love to write and reflect on the latest trends and innovations in the tech space and how history in tech has unfolded over the past few decades.

🎸 During my spare time, I design graphics for a few places I volunteer at and dedicate time to eat and catch-up with close friends. I also play guitar and write songs!

💞️ I'm looking for work right now in any of those areas, so if you think my skill sets and experiences are a good fit for your team or your company, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'm also casually looking for small projects to work on (in the style of "building an app with my close friends from the university"), so if you want to do that, please feel free!

📫 You can send me a direct message on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-fernandez/) (and feel free to glance through my profile) or email me at **joshf.dev@gmail.com**.

Thank you and welcome again to my GitHub repo!
